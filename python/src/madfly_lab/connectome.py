connectome.py

Vendored (copied, not a path dependency) from the sibling `an earlier in-house simulation`
loader -- this author's own earlier, unreleased work -- so `mad-fly-lab` installs
and deploys standalone. This is the framework's ONE source of real
per-neuron connectivity; everything else in MadFly Lab (pruning, browser pack
export, the Mode A server) is built on top of it.

Framework additions on top of the vendored file (see `# madfly-lab:` markers):
  - `ConnectomeData.indices_of_type()` / `.indices_of_prefix()` -- generic,
    circuit-agnostic lookup, so a scene can address ANY real cell type
    (`PAM11`, `LC4`, `MBON01`, ...) without the framework hardcoding it. The
    vendored file only exposed the handful of named pathways its own game
    needed.
  - `ConnectomeData.subgraph()` -- index-remapping induced-subgraph extraction,
    lifted out of the earlier simulation's one-off `scripts/build_pruned_cache.py`
    and generalized so `prune.py` can build a pack for any seed set.

Keep in sync manually if the upstream connectome.py changes.

Fetches REAL per-neuron connectivity from NeuPrint (male-cns:v1.0 dataset) for:

  - the sensorimotor pathway: LPLC1, LPLC2, CT1, DNp03 (~323 real neurons,
    each an individual real cell -- not lumped into "channel" types like the
    original 6-node model).
  - the mushroom body (MB) memory circuit: KC, MBON, PAM, PPL1 (~4,493 real
    neurons) -- the fly's real associative-learning circuit.

Because fetching this from the live NeuPrint server takes real wall-clock
time (minutes, even for the original 6-query version of this project), all
fetched data is cached to disk in `.cache/connectome_<dataset-slug>.npz` and
reused on subsequent runs unless a refresh is explicitly requested.

If neuprint-python isn't installed, no token is given, or the network fetch
fails, falls back to a synthetic mock graph (`_build_mock_connectome_data`)
so the rest of the simulation always has something to run against.
